# About joebocock.com

Welcome to the home of development for my personal website. It contains a bunch of fun stuff and is the main home for any of my writing. It's built with Nextjs, Typescript and Tailwindcss.

# Getting Setup

If you feel like having a poke around locally, any Javascript dev should feel right at home.

- Clone the project
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

...and you're off to the races.

# Deployment

This site is hosted with Github Pages and deployed with Github actions. This process happens automatically upon a push to master.
